Introduction to Geometry: Ancient Greece and the Pythagoreans,"I have to tell you, Ancient Greece is my favorite era of history. Oh, how I wish I could have been there to philosophize with the greats! Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, plus all of the mathematicians, like Pythagoras. He loved math so much, he made a religion out of it! I mean it makes sense, if you transport yourself to that time, where we didn't know any science. Let's look at the world through the eyes of the Pythagoreans!

If you could go back and visit any time in the history of mankind, which would it be? The roaring twenties? The Renaissance? Those are some pretty good ones, no doubt, but my pick would definitely be Ancient Greece. This civilization produced some of the most astounding leaps of intellect in the history of our species. In this era, early society truly evolved into a form that held the triumphs of the mind in highest regard, and as a result, the Greeks revolutionized philosophy, government, and you guessed it, mathematics. While there were many important figures in these fields, some of the best work in math was done by a fellow named Pythagoras. His work influenced great thinkers like Plato, and therefore all of Western civilization. This early branch of mathematics, now called geometry, was derived largely from drawing pictures in the sand, and it is one of the oldest topics in math. Great thinkers would draw shapes like circles, rectangles, and triangles, and try to understand the characteristics of these perfect forms. In this way, mathematics came to be defined as the field of inquiry in which all questions have completely objective answers. The sum of two angles, the ratio of side lengths on a triangle, these are values that can be firmly arrived at and are completely inarguable, just like the solutions of polynomials that we studied in basic algebra. This kind of certainty was impossible in the crude physical world, the mysterious subject of natural philosophy. Mathematics was revered as the study of divine perfection in physical form, and Pythagoras even had a little bit of a club surrounding his beliefs about numbers. Or, we can go ahead and say it, it was a cult. But a nice, math cult. Its members were called Pythagoreans, and among their doctrines was a healthy dash of mysticism for good measure. Some of it turned out to be nonsense of course, like their belief that the orbits of celestial bodies must obey perfect numerical ratios, just like the consonant musical intervals. As it turned out, this space symphony, as romantic as it sounds, is not real. The planets are distributed about the solar system more or less at random, just like every other planetary system we can see in our galaxy. But their contributions to math have stuck around, and between the work of Pythagoras and other great mathematicians like Euclid, mankind’s ability to describe the universe was dramatically transformed. This change was so profound, in fact, that the geometry we learn in high school today is not very different from the geometry of this ancient time. So let’s move forward and learn all about the shapes and angles and axioms that comprise the topic of geometry.","89,522",0,1
"Basic Euclidean Geometry: Points, Lines, and Planes","Pythagoras wasn't the only Greek fellow that was into math, you know. A little bit later, a fellow named Euclid built upon the work of old Pythag, and turned geometry more or less into what we learn in school today. Pretty impressive stuff!

As we just discussed, geometry was developed in ancient Greece, and when we learn the geometry of this time, we refer to it as Euclidian geometry, in reference to the mathematician Euclid, to whom it is attributed. His work, which built upon the work of earlier mathematicians like Pythagoras, describes a set of axioms and postulates from which a variety of theorems can be derived. Let’s learn about the physical constructs that these axioms describe so that we can learn about all the math we can do with them. First we look at a point. This is nothing more than a location in space. It is zero-dimensional, meaning that it has no dimensions of any kind. We represent points with little dots and some capital letter, making sure to realize that the dot we draw is infinitely larger than the point it is meant to represent. From here, we can construct a one-dimensional object by stringing an infinite number of points along a particular dimension. This object is called a line. Points and lines are familiar to us from algebra, but now let’s examine a two-dimensional object. This can be achieved by stringing an infinite number of lines along a dimension perpendicular to the line. This is called a plane. And then if we string an infinite number of planes in either direction, we get three-dimensional space. Point, line, plane, space. Zero, one, two, and three dimensions. Another linearity we can identify is that a point is just a point, but any two points can define a line, since there is only one line that contains both of these points. Extrapolating further, any three points that aren’t all colinear can define a plane, since there is only one plane that contains all three of these points. We should mention that these figures are idealized concepts. We can never create a plane that is infinitely thin so as to legitimately consist of only two spatial dimensions. Even a piece of paper has some thickness, even if it’s hard to see with the human eye. But we can create mental idealizations of these objects and discuss them concretely, and the conclusions we draw from them will have application in the physical world, where we can approximate certain systems as being perfectly Euclidian. Just to list a bit more terminology, while a line extends infinitely along its one dimension in both directions, if we chop one end off, giving it a definite starting point, we call this a ray. If we chop off both ends, leaving some chunk left over in the middle, this is called a line segment. Line segments have two endpoints, rays have one endpoint, and lines have none. We can use lines, rays, and line segments to generate all kinds of figures. We can make shapes with differing numbers of sides, and we can also create all kinds of angles between these lines. There is plenty to discuss regarding the types of angles that are possible, their magnitudes, and their relationships, so let’s move on and talk about angles.","71,123",0,2
Types of Angles and Angle Relationships,"What are angles? What kinds of angles are there and how do they relate? Vertical angles, supplementary angles, complementary angles, corresponding angles, we cover them all in here!

Now we know what lines are, so let’s draw a few. Here are two lines, and they cross at this point. But in what way do they cross? Do they approach one another slowly and then diverge slowly, or is it more rapid? In asking this question, we are asking about the angle between the lines. If a door is closed, it’s just closed. But if it’s open, how open is it? Is it slightly ajar, is it wide open? The angle between the door and the wall simply represents a way of reporting how open the door is without having to make any reference to any spatial dimensions. Angles are measurements that are independent of the dimensions of objects, and they are ubiquitous in our every day life. To begin examining angles, we can just look at two rays that start at the same point, which we can call the vertex, and the distance between the rays, denoted by this curved line segment, is an angle. Moving these rays closer together and further apart, while their endpoints are anchored together, will generate different angles. While there are a few ways to measure angles, we will first learn how to use degrees. There are three hundred sixty degrees in a circle, so we can take this tiny angle, watch it increase up to ninety degrees, and then continue all the way until one hundred eighty, at which point we just have a line. If we continue in this direction, it will then go down from one hundred eighty all the way back to zero, since the angle will be getting smaller, just on the other side. Let’s learn about some types of angles. If an angle is less than ninety degrees, it’s called an acute angle. We can remember this because an acute angle is cute and tiny. If an angle is exactly ninety degrees, this is a right angle, and this will be denoted by a square. If the angle is between ninety and one hundred eighty degrees, this is called an obtuse angle. So we should now be able to look at any angle and label it as acute, right, or obtuse. Now instead of two rays, let’s use two lines. If these lines cross, we generate four angles. What are the relationships of these angles? First we can examine the angles that are directly opposite one another, like these two. These are called vertical angles, and they are always equal to one another. This seems intuitive by looking at the diagram, but geometry is all about rigorously proving things that might seem obvious, though we don’t know why. We also have adjacent angles, which are the ones that are next to each other, and if these are the result of two lines crossing like this, these are also called supplementary angles. We can also have complementary angles, which add up to ninety degrees. With these rules alone, we should be able to look at a diagram like this with some unknown angles, and solve for the unknown angles on the basis of these rules. Let’s also recall some relationships between lines. If two lines within a plane intersect at a right angle, they are called perpendicular lines. If two lines within a plane do not intersect, they are called parallel lines. If we draw two parallel lines and then a third line that crosses both of them, we can define some more terms. These four angles on the inside are called interior angles. These four angles on the oustide are called exterior angles. Because of the relationships between vertical angles and supplementary angles, we can see that there are two sets of four equivalent angles here. First, each angle is equal to the one across from it. Then, these angles here are called alternate interior angles, and if these lines are parallel, they must be equal. The same goes for these alternate exterior angles, they must also be equal. This is stated by the alternate interior angles theorem and the alternate exterior angles theorem. There is also the same-side interior angles theorem, which tells us that interior angles on the same side of the transversal are supplementary. That makes sense because these are supplementary, and this one is equal to this one, so these two must also add up to one eighty. Lastly, angles in the same position with respect to one another are called corresponding angles. We will see diagrams like this quite a lot in geometry, and we may even have do algebra with them. Like if we set these complementary angles equal to three X and X plus ten. How do we find the measure of these angles? We just use the definition of complementary angles. They must add up to ninety degrees, so we make an equation, combine like terms to get four X plus ten equals ninety, subtract ten and divide by four, which gives us twenty degrees for X. Plugging in twenty, that makes the angles thirty and sixty degrees. Now that we’ve worked a bit with lines, it’s time to look at shapes, which each have some number of line segments for sides. If we are talking about straight lines, we can’t have a shape with one line segment, nor two, so it would seem that three line segments are the minimum required to produce a shape, and this simplest shape is called a triangle. Let’s move forward and learn about all different kinds of triangles, but first, let’s check comprehension.","307,152",0,3
Types of Triangles in Euclidean Geometry,"If a shape is made of straight line segments, the minimum number of sides it can have is three. And three sides make a triangle! I'm sure you knew that.

We know that if we connect three line segments, we can create a simple shape called a triangle. But in what way will these lines connect, and what are the different types of triangles that will result? Let’s go through a list of the most common types of triangles now. First, a few general definitions. Since we know what acute, obtuse, and right angles are, we can then learn about acute, obtuse, and right triangles. Acute triangles have angles that are all acute, or less than ninety degrees. An obtuse triangle has one obtuse angle, or more than ninety degrees. And a right triangle has one right angle. As we can see by looking at the angles in these triangles, and every other triangle we could possibly draw, the angles in a triangle will always add up to one hundred eighty degrees. This is why any triangle can have at most one right or obtuse angle, because two of them would add up to 180 or more, and then there is nothing left for the third angle. This fact will help us algebraically determine the measures of certain angles later. Triangles can be classified not just by angles, but also by side lengths. A scalene triangle is defined as having three sides of different lengths. An isosceles triangle has two sides out of the three that are exactly the same length, and therefore two angles that are precisely the same measure, specifically the two angles that are opposite the two identical sides. And an equilateral triangle has all three sides of the same length, and therefore three identical angles. Since the three identical angles must add up to one hundred eighty degrees, each angle must therefore be sixty degrees in an equilateral triangle. Every triangle must be one of these three types, because if they have three sides, it must either be the case that they are all the same, two are the same, or none are the same, as those are all the options we have. It’s worth our time to also quickly mention some special kinds of right triangles. One is the forty-five forty-five ninety triangle. This will have two legs of equal length, X, and a third side, a hypotenuse, of length X root two. There are also thirty-sixty-ninety triangles, and these have sides of length X, X root three, and two X. Now that we are equipped with all of this information, we should be able to look at a diagram like this and fill in all the missing angles. We just fill them in one at a time by using the rules we know. If we have one of two vertical angles, the other will be the same as the first. If we have two angles in a triangle, then the third will be one eighty minus the other two. If we have one of two adjacent angles, the other will be one eighty minus the first, as these are supplementary, such as with the case of an exterior angle like this one. The exterior angle will also be equal to the sum of the other two angles in the triangle, since this one plus the exterior angle equals one eighty, and this one plus the other two equals one eighty, so these values must be equal. This kind of reasoning is the essence of geometry. All we are really doing is drawing pictures in the sand like the Greeks did, and asking questions about them. What can and can’t be true about these shapes? It’s like a playground for the brain, and if we follow the rules of the playground, we get meaningful answers to questions. These kinds of rules, like the ones that dictate angle relationships, will be applied constantly during our study of geometry, so let’s check comprehension.","51,825",0,4
Proving Triangle Congruence and Similarity,"Now we know about different kinds of triangles and their characteristics, so we should be able to look at two triangles and say whether they are similar, congruent, or unrelated.

In geometry, we are sometimes concerned with proving things. Unlike the real world, where nothing can ever be proven, only shown to be consistent beyond reasonable doubt, in the perfect realm of mathematics, things can indeed be proven to be inarguably true, and our construction of proofs, as meticulous as they may seem, are incredible demonstrations of logic. One of the things we will want to prove is the relationship between two shapes, like two triangles. Two triangles might be unrelated, or they may have some special relationship. They could be similar, meaning they have precisely the same shape, just different sizes, or they could be congruent, meaning they are absolutely identical. When trying to demonstrate similarity, we have to look at the corresponding sides and angles. Here are two triangles that look like they might be similar. We can prove they are similar if the corresponding sides have lengths that are proportional, or if the corresponding angles are identical. This means that if this triangle has sides equal to two, four, and six, while this one has sides equal to four, eight, and twelve, the two triangles must be similar. Also, if this triangle has angles of thirty, sixty, and ninety, and so does this one, these triangles must be similar, no matter what the side lengths. We can also prove triangle congruence through different methods. First, there is the side side side theorem. This states that if the three sides of a triangle are identical to the three sides of the other triangle, they must be congruent, because there is only one way for three sides of particular lengths to come together. If any of the angles were any different, the side lengths would have to change accordingly to maintain a closed shape. Similarly, we can use the side angle side theorem. If two sides of a triangle and the angle between them are identical to the two sides and included angle of another triangle, they must be congruent. If we construct this much of a triangle, there will only be one possible way to connect the two open ends. A variation of this is the hypotenuse-leg theorem. This uses the hypotenuse and one leg of a right triangle, as well as the right angle that is implied. If two right triangles have the same values for the hypotenuse and one leg, they must be congruent. There is also the angle side angle theorem. If there is a side of a particular length, and the other two sides that will extend from endpoints of this line segment must emerge at particular angles, then there is only one place where they could meet and finish the triangle, so any triangles with these two angles and an included side of this length must be congruent. Lastly, there is the angle angle side theorem. This is the same as the angle side angle theorem except that the side involved is not the one in between the two angles in question, it is one of the other two sides. This also proves congruence because if these angles are fixed and this side length is fixed, the other two sides must also be of particular lengths if this is to form a closed triangle. These are some ways that we can prove triangle similarity and congruence, and once proven, we can calculate all kinds of information, so with that understood, let’s check comprehension.","39,881",0,5
"Special Lines in Triangles: Bisectors, Medians, and Altitudes","What's a median? Or an altitude? They are special lines you can make with a triangle.

Let’s quickly identify some other lines that we can draw on triangles. One line we could draw is a perpendicular bisector. This is a line that is perpendicular to one of the sides of the triangle and cuts that side into two line segments of equal length. Any point on this bisector must be equidistant from the endpoints of these line segments, so if the bisector also coincides with the other two sides, then these two sides must be equal, and we have a right triangle. This also makes the two smaller triangles congruent. Besides perpendicular bisectors, we can also describe angle bisectors, which are lines that cut an angle in half. Any point on this angle bisector will be equidistant from the two other lines. Now let’s see what happens if we have a triangle, and we try to draw three perpendicular bisectors, starting from the middle of each side. These extend from each midpoint at a ninety degree angle, and meet at some location, called the circumcenter of the triangle. The circumcenter will be inside the triangle if it is acute, outside of the triangle if it is obtuse, and on the triangle if it is a right triangle. While the distance to the sides of the triangle may differ, the circumcenter will be equidistant from the vertices of the triangle, meaning that the distance from the circumcenter to each corner is the same, no matter what type of triangle we are looking at. The circumcenter of the triangle will also be the center of the circle that circumscribes that triangle. This is the circle that contains all three vertices of the triangle. We can also discuss what happens if we bisect all the angles of a triangle. These angle bisectors will meet somewhere called the incenter of the triangle, and unlike the circumcenter, the incenter will always be inside the triangle. The incenter will be equidistant from the sides of the triangle, so these three lengths must be the same. The incenter will be the center of the circle that is inscribed in the triangle, which is the circle that intersects each side of the triangle at precisely one point. These theorems can be used to prove all kinds of things about various triangles, like the measure of certain angles and the lengths of certain line segments, we just use the postulates strategically. Now instead of a bisector, let’s look at something called a median. A median of a triangle is a line segment that connects one vertex and the midpoint of the opposite side. Notice that this is not a bisector only because these are not right angles, if they were right angles, this median would also be a bisector, and we would have a right triangle. But it’s not, so it’s just a median. If we find the point where all three medians meet, this is called the centroid of the triangle, and like the incenter, this is always inside the triangle. The centroid is always two thirds of the way from one vertex to the opposite side, so that means that this distance is twice this, this distance is twice this, and this distance is twice this. This allows us to determine the lengths of certain line segments given others. We can also identify the altitude of a triangle. This is what we get when we start from a vertex and make a line segment that extends towards the opposite side in perpendicular fashion. If we have to extend the opposite side in one direction or the other to get this, that’s what we do, we just need to make a right angle. Each triangle has three altitudes, one per vertex, and the place where these altitudes converge is called the orthocenter of the triangle. So to quickly summarize, the point where perpendicular bisectors meet is called the circumcenter. Notice the right angles at the midpoints of the sides. This will be equidistant from the vertices. The point where the angle bisectors meet is called the incenter. This will be equidistant from the sides. The point where the three medians meet is called the centroid, and the point where the three altitudes meet is called the orthocenter. Again, notice the right angles required to get the orthocenter, whereas for the centroid the angles can have any value. Let’s check comprehension.","57,376",0,6

We just looked at all kinds of bisectors and other lines that pertain to triangles, so let’s learn just one more type. A midsegment of a triangle is a line segment that joins the midpoints of two sides of the triangle. Every triangle will therefore have precisely three midsegments, and these three line segments form another triangle, the midsegment triangle. Since the vertices of the midsegment triangle are the midpoints of these sides, we can know that the segments on either side of a midpoint are equal to one another. This is signified by these tick marks, one line here and one line here means these are the same. Two lines here and two lines here means these are the same as each other, but not necessarily the same as the segments with one tick mark. Three tick marks, same idea. Furthermore, the triangle midsegment theorem states that any midsegment of a triangle is parallel to one of the sides of the triangle and is also precisely half the length of that side. So here we can see one midsegment and the side of the triangle that it is parallel to. The midsegment is half the length of the side, and since the side is split up into two equal sections, the midsegment is equal to both of these two sections. We can say the same thing for the other two midsegments and their corresponding parallel sides. This allows us to draw all kinds of figures like this one, where some lengths are given and others can be determined. If we know the length of this midsegment, we know this side length. If we know this other side length, then we know the length of this other midsegment. There’s plenty of algebra we can do with this theorem, so let’s check comprehension.","98,505",0,7
The Pythagorean Theorem,"This one is famous! And super ancient.

There is one more very important theorem we need to discuss regarding triangles. While some theorems seem pretty obvious, there is a theorem relating the side lengths of a right triangle that is not so obvious. This theorem is called the Pythagorean theorem, named for Pythagoras himself, even though the theorem was likely discovered prior to Ancient Greece. Nevertheless it was an impressive feat of logic, and one of the most famous mathematical relationships, so let’s go over it now. In a right triangle, there is one ninety degree angle, by definition. The two sides that meet to form this right angle are called the legs of the triangle, and the third side, the one opposite the right angle, is called the hypotenuse. This theorem states that the sum of the squares of the legs of a right triangle is equal to the square of the hypotenuse. This is represented by the equation A squared plus B squared equals C squared, where A and B are the legs, and C is the hypotenuse. This means that given any two sides of a right triangle, we can calculate the third. For example, let’s say the legs have lengths of five and twelve. We just plug these in as A and B, square them, and we get twenty-five plus one hundred forty four, which is one hundred sixty nine. Since this is equal to C squared, we have to take the square root of both sides. This gives us plus or minus thirteen for C. Since this is not algebra but rather geometry, and we are looking at shapes, we can throw away the negative value, because it doesn’t make sense for a side length to be negative, so we can definitively say that this hypotenuse has a length of thirteen. Likewise, we could know the hypotenuse and one leg, and calculate the other leg. Say we have five and nine. That means five squared plus B squared equals nine squared. Twenty-five plus B squared equals eighty-one, B squared equals fifty-six, and B must be root fifty six, which can be simplified to root four times root fourteen, or two root fourteen. The lengths won’t always be neat and tidy integers, so we’d better get used to this. Sometimes we do algebra using the pythagorean theorem. Say the legs of a right triangle are equal to X and four root three, while the hypotenuse is equal to two X. What are all the side lengths? Well we can plug these terms into the theorem just like we would any numbers. After squaring everything, on the left we have X squared, plus four squared is sixteen times root three squared which is three, giving us forty-eight. On the right, two X quantity squared is four X squared. We subtract X squared, divide by three, and take the square root. Once again, although we technically get plus and minus four, negative four doesn’t make any sense here, so X must be four. That makes the missing sides four and eight. This theorem is incredibly useful and ubiquitous in math. So how was it derived? How can we know for sure that this relationship between the sides of a right triangle is true? A satisfactory proof will require the ability to calculate the area of certain shapes, so I promise we will return to this question very soon. For now, let’s check comprehension.","38,344",0,8

We’ve been talking about triangles for a while now, so let’s talk about shapes with more than three sides. Any shape with four sides is called a quadrilateral, and there are many different types. With four sides there must be four angles, and if we place various constraints on these sides and angles, we get specific types of quadrilaterals. For example, if a quadrilateral has precisely one pair of parallel sides, it is a trapezoid. The other pair of sides must not be parallel, which can produce a variety of different trapezoids. A kite is a quadrilateral that has two pairs of congruent consecutive sides. That means these two are the same length, and these two are the same length. Kites have diagonals that are perpendicular. In this other quadrilateral, these opposite sides are parallel and of equal length, or congruent, and so are these two. Because of this, opposite angles are also congruent. Any quadrilateral that meets these constraints is called a parallelogram. The diagonals of a parallelogram always bisect one another. Now from here we can narrow things down further. Any parallelogram that has four congruent sides is called a rhombus. Any parallelogram that has four congruent angles, and therefore four right angles, is a rectangle. And lastly, any parallelogram that has four congruent sides and four right angles is a square. Therefore, a square qualifies as a rectangle, rhombus, parallelogram, and quadrilateral, it is just a specific subset of these different shapes, which we can see in this diagram where different bubbles represent different shapes. Squares sit all the way in the middle, which demonstrates how they also qualify as some of the other shapes that have fewer constraints. So we can think of each new constraint as generating a new and more specific type of quadrilateral. This is what we mean when we say that a square is a rectangle but a rectangle is not necessarily a square. Any square must have four right angles, so it is a rectangle, but it must also have four equal sides, and not all rectangles have four equal sides, so most rectangles are not squares. This is a syllogism, a form of deductive reasoning that we can use in everyday arguments. But we won’t get into logic and philosophy here, that will have to wait for another day. Now that we know the various quadrilaterals, what about shapes with more than four sides? These are called polygons. To be specific, a polygon is any shape formed from three or more line segments, so triangles and quadrilaterals are technically polygons, but since we have specific names for those, we usually only use the word polygon to refer to shapes with five sides are more. We must understand that only shapes with straight lines for sides count as polygons, so circles are not polygons. We have prefixes that indicate how many sides and therefore also how many angles are in a polygon. Starting with five sides we can have pentagons, hexagons, heptagons, octagons, nonagons, and decagons. To qualify as these shapes, they simply have to have these numbers of sides, which can be of any length, and form any angles with one another. If a polygon has all of its sides and angles equal to one another, then it is a regular polygon, and these are the shapes that are most familiar to us, like the regular octagonal stop-sign. Each shape will have its angles add up to a specific number. As we said, the angles of a triangle add up to one eighty. A quadrilateral can be cut up into two triangles, so two times one eighty means that the angles of a quadrilateral will add up to three sixty. A pentagon can be split up into three triangles, so its angles add up to five forty. A hexagon can be split up into four triangles, so its angles add up to seven twenty. We could go on and on in this fashion, and every shape will contain a number of triangles that is two less than its number of sides. So to find out what the angles of a polygon add up to, take the number of sides it has, subtract two, and multiply by one eighty. Now that we know about a variety of shapes, let’s check comprehension.","248,075",0,9
Calculating the Perimeter of Polygons,"You may have heard the term perimeter before, in like a spy movie or something. What does it mean in geometry? Find out here!

Sometimes in movies, someone will shout: “secure the perimeter!” What this means is to guard or enclose the boundary of an area so that no one gets in or out. In geometry, the word perimeter has a similar meaning, it’s the distance around a shape or figure. Finding the perimeter of a polygon is usually pretty easy, we just have to add up the lengths of all the sides, and that will give us the distance around the shape. This was one of the earliest mathematical necessities, as early farmers had to know how much material they needed to enclose their land and guard their animals or crops. Here is an irregular pentagon. Given these sides lengths, we just add them up, and that’s the perimeter. This is the same thing as asking: if you walked along each edge of the shape, all the way back to where you started, how far did you walk? If we don’t know one or more of the sides, we can usually calculate them, depending on what shape we are looking at. First let’s look at rectangles. These have both a length and a width. Since there are four sides total, two lengths and two widths, the perimeter of a rectangle is equal to L plus W plus L plus W, or two L plus two W. So if the dimensions of a rectangle are four by two, we can just plug these into the equation, and we see that we get twelve for the perimeter. For squares it’s even simpler, it’s just the side length times four, since all the sides are the same. Sometimes we may be given a perimeter problem that we can do algebra with. Say we have a rectangle with a perimeter of twenty-four, and its length is three times its width. What are the dimensions of the rectangle? Well we know that two L plus two W must equal twenty-four. We also know that L equals three W. Remember how to solve two equations with two unknowns by substitution? Let’s put three W in place of L in this equation, which gives us six W plus two W, or eight W, equals twenty-four. We divide by eight, W must be three, and therefore L must be nine. The rectangle is three by nine. For a triangle, again we add up the sides, and if we have a right triangle with an unknown length, we know that we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the missing side. Like this one, if the legs are three and four, we know the hypotenuse must be five, and the perimeter is therefore twelve. Sometimes we may be given an irregular polygon like this one, with some of the side lengths filled in and others not. This isn’t too hard once we realize that we can figure out the missing side lengths by looking at the others, and imagining a rectangle behind this shape. If these two sides add up to become one side of the imaginary rectangle, then these two sides must add up the same value, so we just find the difference to label the missing side. We can do this for all the missing sides, and then we just add up all the side lengths to get the perimeter. So that’s all we need to know to find the perimeter of any polygon. Remember, this works for shapes made of straight line segments only, when we introduce curvature, things get much trickier very quickly, and if the curvature is not perfectly circular, we will need calculus to do it. We aren’t there yet, but speaking of curvature, we haven’t discussed circles very much up to this point, so let’s move on to those next, right after we check comprehension.","48,267",0,10

We’ve been talking about polygons for a while, which are shapes made of line segments. There are plenty of other shapes to talk about where the edges are not straight lines, but are curved in some way. The simplest of these shapes, or really, the simplest of all shapes, is the circle. A circle is simply the set of all points that are a particular fixed distance from some central point. So unlike triangles and other polygons where we have to define all kinds of side lengths and angles, to get a circle we only need to define two things. These are the center of the circle, and then a specific distance from that point, like five centimeters. If we draw all the points in this plane that are five centimeters away from this central point, we get a circle. The distance from the center to any point on the circle is called the radius of the circle, and any line segment connecting the center and some point on the circle can be referred to as a radius. Other line segments of note include chords, which are line segments with both endpoints on the circle. A chord that passes through the center of the circle is called a diameter, and we will note that the length of any diameter of a circle is always exactly twice the length of its radius. Lastly, any part of a circle defined by two endpoints is called an arc. If this arc becomes the whole circle, which represents the distance around the circle, or the perimeter of the circle, this is called the circumference. Just the way that the diameter and radius are always in a two to one ratio, the circumference and the diameter also have a special ratio, and that ratio is represented by the number pi. This is an irrational number, which as we discussed before, is a number that can’t be expressed as the ratio of two fractions. This means that it has a decimal representation with digits that go on forever, without any kind of repeating pattern. While this is sufficiently mind-boggling when you think about it, for our meager purposes we can just estimate pi as being three point one four, as that will give us values that are precise enough to be meaningful. So the equations we need to know are as follows. D equals two R, and C equals pi D, or in terms of R, C equals two pi R, since one D is two R’s. Knowing this, if we are given any of these values for a circle, we can find the others. For example, if the radius is five, what is the circumference? Well, we can double the radius to get a diameter of ten, and then multiply by pi to get a circumference of ten pi. Going backwards, if we have a circumference of eighteen pi, we can find a diameter of eighteen, and a radius of nine. If we draw several radii on one circle, we will demarcate several sectors of that circle. A sector is a part of a circle enclosed by two radii and the arc that connects them, like a slice of pizza. Within this sector there is a central angle, and the angles of all the sectors in a circle will always add up to three hundred sixty, or one full revolution. There will be plenty more to discuss regarding circles later, but for now, let’s check comprehension.","60,302",0,11
Calculating the Area of Shapes,"We know about all kinds of one-dimensional parameters, like side lengths and what not, but now we want to talk about the two-dimensional area that a shape will occupy.

Once we know how to calculate one-dimensional lengths like perimeters and diameters, it is time to learn how to calculate two-dimensional areas. This is the amount of surface that a figure covers. We must understand that while side lengths and perimeters can be measured in any unit of distance, like meters, area will be expressed in square units, like square meters, which are meters squared. To see why, let’s look at something simple, like a square. Say this square has a side length of five meters. How much surface does it cover? To answer that, we can take this line segment that represents one side of the square, and realize that to span the shape, we are extending this line segment across the shape. So it’s a five meter length that is being pushed across the five meter length of the adjacent side. Five meters times five meters gives us twenty-five meters squared. We must remember that units will be manipulated just like algebraic variables, so meters times meters is meters squared just the way that X times X is X squared. So with that, we understand the formula for the area of a square. It is a side times a side, and by definition the sides of a square are the same, so it’s side squared. If we are looking at some other rectangle that is not a square, the area will be length times width, which will be different numbers. Here is a rectangle that is four meters by six meters, so the area is twenty-four meters squared. This approach works for any parallelogram as well, but instead of multiplying the sides, we multiply the base times the height. The height of a parallelogram is essentially its width, which we get if we draw a line between the base and the opposite side that is perpendicular to both. It becomes very clear why this works if we draw the height right here, chop off this triangular segment, and move it to the other side to make a perfect rectangle. Now we can see that base times height on the parallelogram is the same as length times width on the corresponding rectangle. Now that we are back to rectangles, let’s draw the diagonal, thus splitting it into two triangles. Each triangle has half the area of the rectangle. That’s how we get the area of a triangle, we multiply the base times the height, which would give us the area of the rectangle this triangle fits into, but then we cut it in half. One half base times height. So this triangle, with a base of six meters and a height of four meters, will have an area of twelve square meters. This works whether the triangle is a right triangle or not. Even though it’s a little harder to see how this triangle is half of this rectangle, because it splits the rectangle up into more than two pieces, we can still use one half base times height. Trapezoids are a little different. For these, we do one half the height times the sum of the two bases. So with bases of six and ten meters and a height of four meters, we plug these all in to get an area of thirty-two square meters. Sometimes we will want to find the area of a shape that is quite irregular. To do this, we might break these figures up into simpler shapes that are more familiar. Take this shape. Given all of these side lengths, we can split this up into two rectangles. Then we just get the areas of the two rectangles and add them together. Same with this figure, which can be split up into a rectangle and a triangle. We just get all the side lengths, and then plug values into their respective equations for area. With circles, things are a bit different. The area for a circle is given by pi R squared, or pi times the radius squared. So if a circle has a radius of three meters, the area will be nine pi square meters. Knowing this, we can calculate the area of even more irregular figures, as there are ones that will have rectangular pieces and semicircular pieces. We can split these up just like we did before, and the rectangular part will be easy, while for the semicircle we figure out a way to get the radius of the circle, and then we calculate pi R squared and just cut it in half, since it’s half a circle. And that’s really all we need to know to calculate the area of simple shapes and some irregular ones, so it’s a good idea to memorize this handful of formulas for the areas of a square, rectangle, parallelogram, triangle, trapezoid, and circle. Let’s check comprehension.","255,630",0,12

As I mentioned before when we initially learned the Pythagorean theorem, there are very elegant ways to prove that the theorem is true, and now that we know how to calculate area, we are ready to perform one such proof ourselves. Let’s say we draw a right triangle like this one, and label the sides A, B, and C, like we are used to. Now let’s make three more copies of this triangle and arrange them like this, so that we get two squares. The larger square has a side length of A plus B, while the smaller inner square has a side length of C. We can calculate the areas of all of these shapes. We know that the area of one of the triangles will be one half base times height, or one half A times B. The area of the large square will be the side length squared, or A plus B quantity squared. And the small square will have an area of C squared. Now let’s set up a relationship between these areas. The area of the large square is equal to A plus B quantity squared as we just said, but it is also equal to the area of the small square plus the area of all the triangles, since these shapes comprise the larger square. So we can make an equation that states the following. A plus B quantity squared, the area of the big square, is equal to four times one half AB, which is four times the area of one triangle, since there are four triangles, plus C squared, the area of the small square. We know how to square a binomial by using the FOIL method, so let’s take away the exponent and just write the binomial out twice. First gives us A squared, outer gives us AB, inner gives us AB, and last gives us B squared. Combining like terms, that’s A squared plus two AB plus B squared. On the right, we can multiply four and one half, and we get two AB plus C squared. As it happens, we have two AB on both sides, so those will cancel out, and wouldn’t you know it, take a look at what we are left with. The Pythagorean theorem. I hope this result makes you feel warm and fuzzy inside, because proofs like this are what math is really all about. There are many other proofs of this theorem that involve similar calculations with triangles and squares and other shapes, so if you’re just dying to know them all, it’s time to hit the internet.

For quite a few tutorials we’ve been looking at lines and polygons and circles, and all kinds of other things, but these geometrical figures have all been contained in a single plane. They are all two-dimensional. We know that in the real world, objects are three-dimensional, nothing is completely flat, not even a piece of paper, so it’s important to understand the geometry of three-dimensional shapes as well. Let’s go through some of these shapes now, and talk about some of their parameters that we can calculate. First of all, rather than calling these things shapes, let’s refer to them by their proper name, polyhedrons. A polyhedron is a three-dimensional object with flat surfaces called faces, and each face of a polyhedron is a polygon. Where two faces meet and share a side, this is called an edge, and any point where three or more edges meet is called a vertex. The first type of polyhedron we will look at is the prism. This is a shape with two congruent parallel bases of some type of polygon, and all the other shapes are parallelograms. A prism is named for the shape of its bases. This is a rectangular prism. We can see the bases, and all the rectangular sides, which qualify as parallelograms. We can have pentagonal and hexagonal prisms as well, we just have parallel bases of the shape that is referenced, and then as many rectangles connecting the two bases as are necessary. Another type of shape is a cylinder. Cylinders have two circular bases, but they are not considered polyhedra, because none of these surfaces are polygons. Next we want to look at pyramids. Unlike prisms, these have only one base, which is a polygon of some sort, and rather than parallelograms that connect to another base, we have triangles that come together at a point. A pyramid is named for the shape of its base. This is a square pyramid. This is a triangular pyramid. And we could certainly have pyramid bases with more sides than this. A similar shape is a cone, which is sort of like a pyramid but with a circular base. Again, cones are not polyhedra, because these faces are not polygons. Now, what can we do with these polyhedra, what can we describe? Well we know how to calculate the area of certain polygons, so we could calculate the total area of all the faces of a polyhedron. This is called the surface area, quite literally the area on the surface of a three-dimensional shape, which we can think of as the amount of wrapping paper we would need to wrap up a gift of a particular shape, just barely covering all of it. Take something like a rectangular prism. This has six sides. These two are the same, these two are the same, and these two are the same. To get the surface area, we just have to get the area of each rectangle, and add them all up. Given the dimensions of two by three by four meters, we get two rectangles that are two by three, two that are two by four, and two that are three by four. That’s two times six plus two times eight plus two times twelve, which equals fifty-two square meters. What about for a pyramid like this square pyramid? Now we have a couple different shapes. We have this square base and then four triangles, so it’s the formula for the area of a square plus four times the area for a triangle. If we have a base with a side length of five meters and triangles with bases that are just the side of the square, and with heights of six meters, then we can get the area of the square first, which is five squared, or twenty-five, and then each triangle will be one half five times six, or fifteen. There’s four of them, so that’s sixty. Twenty-five plus sixty is eighty-five square meters. What about a cylinder? This one seems like it would be complicated, but it’s actually just two circles plus a rectangle that’s curved around on itself. We can imagine slicing through the height of the cylinder and unwrapping it to get this rectangle, which will have one side equal to the height of the cylinder, and another side equal to the circumference of the base of the cylinder. So the area of a cylinder is twice the area of the circle, since there’s one on the top and one on the bottom, plus the area of this rectangle, which is height times circumference, which is pi D or two pi R. So if we have a radius of two meters and a height of five meters, we can get the rectangle first, which will be five times two pi times two, or twenty pi. Then we have two circles, which means pi times two squared to get the area for each circle, which will add up to eight pi. Add these values together and we get twenty eight pi. Lastly, let’s find the surface area of a sphere, which is the set of all points in space that are a fixed distance from a central point, with that distance being the radius of the sphere. The surface area of a sphere is given by four pi R squared, so with a radius of five, that would be twenty-five, times four is one hundred, times pi is one hundred pi square meters. That’s quite a lot of shapes and ways to calculate surface area, so let’s check comprehension.","32,761",0,14

We just learned how to calculate the two-dimensional area covered by the surface of a three-dimensional object, but sometimes we want to do more than that. Sometimes we want to calculate the three-dimensional space that is contained within that object, which we can think of as the amount of water we will need to fill up the object if it were perfectly hollow. Just the way the area of a square is found by running a side length across the shape, if we take that square plane and run it across a third dimension, we can get a cube. A cube is a prism with squares for all its faces. To find the volume of a cube, instead of just squaring the side length, which gives us the area of one square face, we cube the side length to get the volume of the cube. With a side length of two meters, this cube has a volume of eight meters cubed, or cubic meters. We can easily visualize this by saying that if we have some one by one by one cubes, or cubic units, it will take eight of them to fill this larger cube. For a rectangular prism, it’s just length times width times height. Two times three times five gives thirty cubic meters. What we are really doing is calculating the area of the base, and multiplying by the height, as though running the base up through the height of the shape to span its volume. This works for any type of prism, like a triangular prism. Here we have triangular bases, so we just get the area of one base, and multiply by the height. If the triangle itself has a base and height of two and three meters, and the prism has a height of ten meters, we get one half two times three times ten, or thirty cubic meters. This works for cylinders, too, it’s always just base times height. The base of a cylinder is a circle, so we find the area of this circle, and then multiply by the height of the cylinder. If the height is six meters and the radius is three, we get pi R squared, or nine pi, times six, or fifty-four pi cubic meters. Now let’s move on to some trickier shapes. How do we calculate the volume of a pyramid? This will be different from a prism, because we can’t just multiply the base times the height, as the triangular faces slope inward. Instead, we will use the formula one third base times height. So if we have a square pyramid which has a base with a length of three, and the pyramid has a height of five, we get nine for the base, times five is forty-five, times one third is fifteen cubic meters. What if we don’t know the height of the pyramid but only the height of the triangles? Luckily we know the pythagorean theorem, so we could imagine a triangle where one leg is the height of the pyramid, the other leg is half the length of the base, and the hypotenuse is the height of a triangular face. We plug them into the equation, and we can then solve for the height, so it’s just one extra step. Cones work just like pyramids. Again it will be one third base times height, except that here the area of the base is given by pi R squared, so we get one third pi R squared H. If we have two for R and nine for H, we get four pi times nine is thirty-six, times a third is twelve cubic meters. Lastly, we need to be able to calculate the volume of a sphere. The formula for this is four thirds pi R cubed. So with a radius of three, we cube it to get twenty-seven, divide by three to get nine, and multiply by four to get thirty-six, times pi is thirty-six pi cubic meters. These are most of the regular shapes for which we have reliable equations to calculate volume. There are, of course, many irregular shapes that have a more unpredictable curvature, and to calculate the volumes of these, we will need calculus. We aren’t there yet, we have lots more algebra to learn first, and since we’ve wrapped up most of the crucial topics in geometry, we are safe to go back to equations with variables, right after we check comprehension.","69,054",0,15
